//lab6_4.cpp
//Write three derived classes inheriting functionality of base class person(should have a member function that asks to enter nameand age) and 
//with added unique features of student, and employee, and functionality to assign, changeand delete records of studentand employee.
//And make one member function for printing the address of the objects of classes(base and derived) using this pointer.Create two objects 
//of the base classand derived classes eachand print the addresses of individual objects.
//Using a calculator, calculate the address space occupied by each objectand verify this with address spaces printed by the program.
